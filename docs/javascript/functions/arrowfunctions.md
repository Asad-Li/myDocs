# Arrow Expression

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:

```javascript
  const myArrowFunction = (parameter) => {
  return parameter;
  }
```

### Arrow functions have the following limitations:

- Can't be used as methods in objects
- Can't be used as constructors

### Arrow functions have the following benifits:

- Cleaner syntax
- Simplicity due to limitations

for more limitations/benifits use google lol
